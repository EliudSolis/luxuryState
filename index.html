                    Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real estate marketing company.
                </h2>

                <p class="first__p-p">
                    One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your
                    property to the
                    right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify who
                    will be
                    interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their website, paid
                    advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered with
                    Luxury
                    Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing capabilities the company offers.
                    Here is
                    how:

                <h2>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
                <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time online,
                    and how
                    they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to
                    identify
                    your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those
                    interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring
                    you are
                    not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.

                <h2>Expert Content Production</h2>
                <p>
                    Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property.
                    Being able
                    to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the
                    agents
                    who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey,
                    85
                    percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An
                    agent who
                    uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport.
                    When they
                    use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk
                    through and
                    live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written description.
                    However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described
                    in
                    appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell
                    it. Those
                    agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create
                    blogs,
                    website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

                <h1>Effective Search Engine Optimization
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many of
                    them
                    simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way.
                    For
                    your
                    home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in
                    your
                    online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or
                    SEO.
                    The
                    process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO
                    experts at
                    Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your
                    property
                    will show up in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

                <h1>Social Media Marketing</h1>
                <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of
                    niche
                    buyers
                    who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large
                    chunk of
                    their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service
                    providers
                    who
                    can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your
                    property
                    and let an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team
                    utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their
                    industry.
                    Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for
                    your
                    home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.
